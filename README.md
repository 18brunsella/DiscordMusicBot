# ðŸŽ¶ Discord Music Bot ðŸŽ¶
This is a bot you can have for your Discord server. This music bot will be able to play youtube videos as audio resource in a voice channel in Discord. You will be able to play and stop the current song / audio clip, and also create a queue of songs and empty the queue. 

## Behaviors
This bot can do several things for you. It can:
 - Create a queue for you
 - Stop and resume music if you tell it to
 - Print out the queue list or the current song that is playing
 - Skip songs, going to the next song in the queue 
 - Clear queues 
 - Disconnect if you tell it to 
 
## Prerequisites / Requirements 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16) for environment 
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to process audio **Note:** FFmpeg is needed for the machine that is running this bot

## Hosting 
I am personally hosting on Heroku. You can host on VPS (virtual private server) so you do not need to keep your PC online 24/7.
